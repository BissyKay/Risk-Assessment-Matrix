Steps Followed			
Step 1	I set up mock data by creating a table with the following columns:		
	Risk ID 	Unique Identifier for each risk	
	Risk Description 	Brief description of the risk	
	Likelihood 	The probability of the risk occurring	
	Impact	The severity of the risk if it occurs	
			
Step 2	I assigned risk ratings by		
	Setting up a new column titled risk score		
	Assign numerical values to likelihood and impact:		
	Score Assignment Table 		
	Likelihood	Impact	
	High = 3	High = 3	
	Medium = 2	Medium =2	
	Low = 1	Low =1	
	Multiply the Likelihood score by the Impact score to get the Risk Score.		
			
Step 3 	I created a Heatmap by:		
	I applied conditional formatting to the Risk Score column		
	I applied a three color scale 		
	Red for high risk (9)		
	Yellow for medium risk (4–6)		
	Green for low risk (1–3)		
Step 4 	I created a 3x3 matrix Visualization (Heat Map workbook)
